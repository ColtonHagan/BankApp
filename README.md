Create a program that implements a simple bank account system with the following features:

1. The program should have classes for Account, Customer, and Bank.
2. The Account class should have a constructor that takes the initial balance as a parameter and a method for checking the balance.
3. The Customer class should have a constructor that takes the customer's name as a parameter and a method for returning the customer's name.
4. The Bank class should have a constructor that creates an empty list of accounts and methods for adding and removing accounts, as well as a method for displaying all accounts.
5. The program should allow the user to create a new account and make deposits and withdrawals from the account.
6. The program should also display the current account balance after each transaction.
7. The program should validate that the user enters a positive number for deposits and withdrawals and that the withdrawal amount is not greater than the account balance.
8. The program should also keep track of account number, and check if the account number exists before withdrawal or deposit.

This program can be extended by adding other features such as account history, interest rate, and account type.
